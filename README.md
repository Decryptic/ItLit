# ItLit
find parties and friends
https://www.itlit.io

ItLit is your app for finding parties, making acquaintances while you're out on the town, music festivals, field trips, etc.

On the right, you have a map where you can see all of your friends who are online.

In the middle, you have the lightbulb which toggles whether or not you are online.

On the left, you have your list of friends. If a friend's candle is lit, and your lightbulb is on, that friend will be able to see you on ItLit on their phone, IF they have your phone number in their friend's list.

ItLit respects your privacy. Only friends within the app can see where you are. We neither keep track of nor sell your location data.
